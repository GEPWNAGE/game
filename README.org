#+TITLE: GEPWNAGE Agile Multimedia Experience
* Idea
We want to create a new GEPWNAGE Agile Multimedia Experience for Study
Association GEWIS, to improve synergy with our activities.

The proof of concept will be used for the upcoming Just Dance activity. This
will be a DDR-like engagement experience.
* Goals
- Build a GEPWNAGE Agile Multimedia Experience
- Primarily usable from mobile devices to increase engagement among users.
- Keep the project simple to run and portable, a simple clone, ~npm install~ and ~npm start~
  should be enough for all components to run them. We do not want to rely on
  database servers or things like that.
* Architecture
This project will have three components: a server, a phone client and a screen
client. The screen client will run on the Multimedia screens at GEWIS. While the
phone client will be loaded by users on their own devices. Both will connect to
the server using [[https://socket.io][socket.io]].
